## About The App

Git Hub Searcher is an app that allows the user to search for any GitHub user in order to get, not only his personal information, but also to gain access to his list of repositories. Both user and repositories have access to git itself

## Technologies

Application made in react that accesses the GITHub Rest API using Axios, with styles applied using CSS and tests were made using the react-testing-library

## Setup

- download or clone the repository
- run `npm install`
- ...

## Run

- run `npm start`
- ...

## Test

- run `npm test`
- ...

## Approach

In terms of styling tried to make it cleaner and make it screen adjustable
In terms of coding tried to make the most generic components i could in order to look forward to any application scalability in the future. Pagination component is also generic but i opted to put it on the repositories folder for organization purpose
